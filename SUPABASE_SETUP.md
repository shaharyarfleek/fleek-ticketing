# Supabase Cloud Storage Setup Guide

Your ticketing system has been successfully migrated to use **Supabase Cloud Storage** instead of localStorage. All data will now be stored permanently in the cloud.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Cloud Data Storage
- **Tickets**: All tickets are now stored in Supabase cloud database
- **Users**: User accounts are stored permanently 
- **Comments & Replies**: All conversations are persisted
- **Reminders**: Ticket reminders are stored in the cloud
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes are synced across all devices instantly

### 2. Database Schema
Complete database schema with the following tables:
- `users` - User accounts and profiles
- `tickets` - Support tickets with full metadata
- `comments` - Ticket comments and discussions
- `replies` - Replies to comments
- `reminders` - Ticket reminders and notifications
- `attachments` - File attachments (ready for future implementation)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Start your project" 
3. Create a new project
4. Choose a name and password for your database

### Step 2: Run Database Schema
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the SQL schema from `/src/services/supabase.ts` (the `CREATE_TABLES_SQL` constant)
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor and run it
4. This will create all necessary tables, indexes, and policies

### Step 3: Get Your Credentials
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings > API**
2. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon/public key**

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Create or update your `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Your existing BigQuery and other variables...
VITE_BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_BIGQUERY_DATASET=your-dataset
VITE_BIGQUERY_TABLE=your-table
```

### Step 5: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

- `src/contexts/DataContext.tsx` - Updated to use Supabase instead of localStorage
- `src/services/supabase.ts` - Supabase configuration and database schema
- `src/services/supabaseService.ts` - All cloud database operations

### Database Structure
```sql
-- Users table with profiles and departments
users (id, name, email, role, department_id, department_name, avatar, is_active)

-- Tickets with full metadata and order integration
tickets (id, title, description, status, priority, assignee, reporter, order_number, order_value, tags, etc.)
